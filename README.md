# RESERVOIR-SIZE-ESTIMATION
The following project has as its main aim, teach us how to solve differential equations by different methods such as Dense, Sparse and Thomas.Also we reviewd how can they be solved as time dependent or independent, including the error or not as well . We improve our profficiency coding using a large simulator with a Class and many functions inside which made more efficient our time coding and also using different functions at the same time. At the end we realized that the faster method to solve symmetric tridiagonal systems is Thomas Algortihm with a $0.00028$ seconds, followed by the Dense method with $0.00038671$ seconds and the slowest was Spicy with $0.00229$ when N is not too big. Finnally we plot the pressures we got from the matrix and noticed that the pressure has a steady behavior when is close to the end of the reservoir. From our results we can say that the ratio of the reservoir is $7.200\rm {ft}$, with a volume of $7.38\cdot10^6$ cubic meters.
